IKAZE is a system we've designed for allowing new students at IPRC TUMBA for helping administrator in arranging in living where help them giving room and other activities in school according to related informations. It is composed by two parts, the one
for the sudent registering form and other for the Admin panel. The admin in charge 
will be able to see the list of newcomer students and their respective informations, 
he will be able to delete and update their information.
We build it with the use of PHP PDO and bootstrap for GUI.
