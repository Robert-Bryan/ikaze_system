IKAZE is a system we've designed for allowing new students at IPRC TUMBA to register
themselves for giving their related information. It is composed by two parts, the one
for the sudent registering form and other for the Admin in charge. The admin in charge 
will be able to see the list of newcomer students and their respective informations, 
he will be able to delete and update We build it with the use of PHP PDO and bootstrap for GUI.
